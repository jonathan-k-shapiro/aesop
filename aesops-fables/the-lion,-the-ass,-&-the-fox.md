# The Lion, the Ass, & the Fox

## Story


### Paragraph 1

A Lion, an Ass, and a Fox were hunting in company, and caught a large quantity of game. The Ass was asked to divide the spoil. This he did very fairly, giving each an equal share.



### Paragraph 2

The Fox was well satisfied, but the Lion flew into a great rage over it, and with one stroke of his huge paw, he added the Ass to the pile of slain.



### Paragraph 3

Then he turned to the Fox.



### Paragraph 4

"You divide it," he roared angrily.



### Paragraph 5

The Fox wasted no time in talking. He quickly piled all the game into one great heap. From this he took a very small portion for himself, such undesirable bits as the horns and hoofs of a mountain goat, and the end of an ox tail.



### Paragraph 6

The Lion now recovered his good humor entirely.



### Paragraph 7

"Who taught you to divide so fairly?" he asked pleasantly.



### Paragraph 8

"I learned a lesson from the Ass," replied the Fox, carefully edging away.



## Moral

_Learn from the misfortunes of others._
