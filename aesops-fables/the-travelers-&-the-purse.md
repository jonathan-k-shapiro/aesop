# The Travelers & the Purse

## Story


### Paragraph 1

Two men were traveling in company along the road when one of them picked up a well-filled purse.



### Paragraph 2

"How lucky I am!" he said. "I have found a purse. Judging by its weight it must be full of gold."



### Paragraph 3

"Do not say 'I have found a purse,'" said his companion. "Say rather 'we have found a purse' and 'how lucky we are.' Travelers ought to share alike the fortunes or misfortunes of the road."



### Paragraph 4

"No, no," replied the other angrily. "I found it and I am going to keep it."



### Paragraph 5

Just then they heard a shout of "Stop, thief!" and looking around, saw a mob of people armed with clubs coming down the road.



### Paragraph 6

The man who had found the purse fell into a panic.



### Paragraph 7

"We are lost if they find the purse on us," he cried.



### Paragraph 8

"No, no," replied the other, "You would not say 'we' before, so now stick to your 'I'. Say 'I am lost.'"



## Moral

_We cannot expect any one to share our misfortunes unless we are willing to share our good fortune also._
