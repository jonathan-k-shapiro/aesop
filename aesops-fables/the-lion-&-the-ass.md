# The Lion & the Ass

## Story


### Paragraph 1

One day as the Lion walked proudly down a forest aisle, and the animals respectfully made way for him, an Ass brayed a scornful remark as he passed.



### Paragraph 2

The Lion felt a flash of anger. But when he turned his head and saw who had spoken, he walked quietly on. He would not honor the fool with even so much as a stroke of his claws.



## Moral

_Do not resent the remarks of a fool. Ignore them._
