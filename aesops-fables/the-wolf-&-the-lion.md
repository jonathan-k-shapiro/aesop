# The Wolf & the Lion

## Story


### Paragraph 1

A Wolf had stolen a Lamb and was carrying it off to his lair to eat it. But his plans were very much changed when he met a Lion, who, without making any excuses, took the Lamb away from him.



### Paragraph 2

The Wolf made off to a safe distance, and then said in a much injured tone:



### Paragraph 3

"You have no right to take my property like that!"



### Paragraph 4

The Lion looked back, but as the Wolf was too far away to be taught a lesson without too much inconvenience, he said:



### Paragraph 5

"Your property? Did you buy it, or did the Shepherd make you a gift of it? Pray tell me, how did you get it?"



## Moral

_What is evil won is evil lost._
