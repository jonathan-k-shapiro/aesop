# The Ants & the Grasshopper

## Story


### Paragraph 1

One bright day in late autumn a family of Ants were bustling about in the warm sunshine, drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer, when a starving Grasshopper, his fiddle under his arm, came up and humbly begged for a bite to eat.



### Paragraph 2

"What!" cried the Ants in surprise, "haven't you stored anything away for the winter? What in the world were you doing all last summer?"



### Paragraph 3

"I didn't have time to store up any food," whined the Grasshopper; "I was so busy making music that before I knew it the summer was gone."



### Paragraph 4

The Ants shrugged their shoulders in disgust.



### Paragraph 5

"Making music, were you?" they cried. "Very well; now dance!" And they turned their backs on the Grasshopper and went on with their work.



## Moral

_There's a time for work and a time for play._
