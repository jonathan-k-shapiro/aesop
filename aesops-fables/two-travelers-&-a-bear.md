# Two Travelers & a Bear

## Story


### Paragraph 1

Two Men were traveling in company through a forest, when, all at once, a huge Bear crashed out of the brush near them.



### Paragraph 2

One of the Men, thinking of his own safety, climbed a tree.



### Paragraph 3

The other, unable to fight the savage beast alone, threw himself on the ground and lay still, as if he were dead. He had heard that a Bear will not touch a dead body.



### Paragraph 4

It must have been true, for the Bear snuffed at the Man's head awhile, and then, seeming to be satisfied that he was dead, walked away.



### Paragraph 5

The Man in the tree climbed down.



### Paragraph 6

"It looked just as if that Bear whispered in your ear," he said. "What did he tell you?"



### Paragraph 7

"He said," answered the other, "that it was not at all wise to keep company with a fellow who would desert his friend in a moment of danger."



## Moral

_Misfortune is the test of true friendship._
