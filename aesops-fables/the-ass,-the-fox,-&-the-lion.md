# The Ass, the Fox, & the Lion

## Story


### Paragraph 1

An Ass and a Fox had become close comrades, and were constantly in each other's company. While the Ass cropped a fresh bit of greens, the Fox would devour a chicken from the neighboring farmyard or a bit of cheese filched from the dairy. One day the pair unexpectedly met a Lion. The Ass was very much frightened, but the Fox calmed his fears.



### Paragraph 2

"I will talk to him," he said.



### Paragraph 3

So the Fox walked boldly up to the Lion.



### Paragraph 4

"Your highness," he said in an undertone, so the Ass could not hear him, "I've got a fine scheme in my head. If you promise not to hurt me, I will lead that foolish creature yonder into a pit where he can't get out, and you can feast at your pleasure."



### Paragraph 5

The Lion agreed and the Fox returned to the Ass.



### Paragraph 6

"I made him promise not to hurt us," said the Fox. "But come, I know a good place to hide till he is gone."



### Paragraph 7

So the Fox led the Ass into a deep pit. But when the Lion saw that the Ass was his for the taking, he first of all struck down the traitor Fox.



## Moral

_Traitors may expect treachery._
