# The Mole & his Mother

## Story


### Paragraph 1

A little Mole once said to his Mother:



### Paragraph 2

"Why, Mother, you said I was blind! But I am sure I can see!"



### Paragraph 3

Mother Mole saw she would have to get such conceit out of his head. So she put a bit of frankincense before him and asked him to tell what it was.



### Paragraph 4

The little Mole peered at it.



### Paragraph 5

"Why, that's a pebble!"



### Paragraph 6

"Well, my son, that proves you've lost your sense of smell as well as being blind."



## Moral

_Boast of one thing and you will be found lacking in that and a few other things as well._
