# The Dog & the Oyster

## Story


### Paragraph 1

There was once a Dog who was very fond of eggs. He visited the hen house very often and at last got so greedy that he would swallow the eggs whole.



### Paragraph 2

One day the Dog wandered down to the seashore. There he spied an Oyster. In a twinkling the Oyster was resting in the Dog's stomach, shell and all.



### Paragraph 3

It pained the Dog a good deal, as you can guess.



### Paragraph 4

"I've learned that all round things are not eggs," he said groaning.



## Moral

_Act in haste and repent at leisureâ€”and often in pain._
