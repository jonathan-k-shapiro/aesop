# The Travelers & the Sea

## Story


### Paragraph 1

Two Travelers were walking along the seashore. Far out they saw something riding on the waves.



### Paragraph 2

"Look," said one, "a great ship rides in from distant lands, bearing rich treasures!"



### Paragraph 3

The object they saw came ever nearer the shore.



### Paragraph 4

"No," said the other, "that is not a treasure ship. That is some fisherman's skiff, with the day's catch of savoury fish."



### Paragraph 5

Still nearer came the object. The waves washed it up on shore.



### Paragraph 6

"It is a chest of gold lost from some wreck," they cried. Both Travelers rushed to the beach, but there they found nothing but a water-soaked log.



## Moral

_Do not let your hopes carry you away from reality._
