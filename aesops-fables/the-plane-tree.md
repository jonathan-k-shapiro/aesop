# The Plane Tree

## Story


### Paragraph 1

Two Travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest. As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that it was a Plane Tree.



### Paragraph 2

"How useless is the Plane!" said one of them. "It bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter the ground with leaves."



### Paragraph 3

"Ungrateful creatures!" said a voice from the Plane Tree. "You lie here in my cooling shade, and yet you say I am useless! Thus ungratefully, O Jupiter, do men receive their blessings!"



## Moral

_Our best blessings are often the least appreciated._
