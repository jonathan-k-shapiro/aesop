# The Mule

## Story


### Paragraph 1

A Mule had had a long rest and much good feeding. He was feeling very vigorous indeed, and pranced around loftily, holding his head high.



### Paragraph 2

"My father certainly was a full-blooded racer," he said. "I can feel that distinctly."



### Paragraph 3

Next day he was put into harness again and that evening he was very downhearted indeed.



### Paragraph 4

"I was mistaken," he said. "My father was an Ass after all."



## Moral

_Be sure of your pedigree before you boast of it._
