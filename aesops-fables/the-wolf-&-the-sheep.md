# The Wolf & the Sheep

## Story


### Paragraph 1

A Wolf had been hurt in a fight with a Bear. He was unable to move and could not satisfy his hunger and thirst. A Sheep passed by near his hiding place, and the Wolf called to him.



### Paragraph 2

"Please fetch me a drink of water," he begged, "that might give me strength enough so I can get me some solid food."



### Paragraph 3

"Solid food!" said the Sheep. "That means me, I suppose. If I should bring you a drink, it would only serve to wash me down your throat. Don't talk to me about a drink!"



## Moral

_A knave's hypocrisy is easily seen through._
