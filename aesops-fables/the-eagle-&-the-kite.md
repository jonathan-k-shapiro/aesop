# The Eagle & the Kite

## Story


### Paragraph 1

An Eagle sat high in the branches of a great Oak. She seemed very sad and drooping for an Eagle. A Kite saw her.



### Paragraph 2

"Why do you look so woebegone?" asked the Kite.



### Paragraph 3

"I want to get married," replied the Eagle, "and I can't find a mate who can provide for me as I should like."



### Paragraph 4

"Take me," said the Kite; "I am very strong, stronger even than you!"



### Paragraph 5

"Do you really think you can provide for me?" asked the Eagle eagerly.



### Paragraph 6

"Why, of course," replied the Kite. "That would be a very simple matter. I am so strong I can carry away an Ostrich in my talons as if it were a feather!"



### Paragraph 7

The Eagle accepted the Kite immediately. But after the wedding, when the Kite flew away to find something to eat for his bride, all he had when he returned, was a tiny Mouse.



### Paragraph 8

"Is that the Ostrich you talked about?" said the Eagle in disgust.



### Paragraph 9

"To win you I would have said and promised anything," replied the Kite.



## Moral

_Everything is fair in love._
