# The Farmer & the Stork

## Story


### Paragraph 1

A Stork of a very simple and trusting nature had been asked by a gay party of Cranes to visit a field that had been newly planted. But the party ended dismally with all the birds entangled in the meshes of the Farmer's net.



### Paragraph 2

The Stork begged the Farmer to spare him.



### Paragraph 3

"Please let me go," he pleaded. "I belong to the Stork family who you know are honest and birds of good character. Besides, I did not know the Cranes were going to steal."



### Paragraph 4

"You may be a very good bird," answered the Farmer, "but I caught you with the thieving Cranes and you will have to share the same punishment with them."



## Moral

_You are judged by the company you keep._
